"I think students would benefit from learning at home because they don't have to change and get up early in the morning to shower and do their hair, only lessons help them because they get more attention in their home. They'll feel comfortable at home. The hardest part of school is to get ready. You wake up, brush your teeth and go into the closet and look at the clothes. After you think you've picked an outfit, you go in the mirror and you either don't like it or you see and see a stain. Then you have to change. With online classes, you can wear anything and stay at home and you don't have to stress what to wear. Most students usually take a shower before school, they either take it before they go to sleep or when they wake up. Some students smell both, which causes them to miss the bus and the impact on class time that they come to school late and don't know how to miss class because you can set everything up and the students are ready to go.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,train
"When a problem is a change, the best thing to do is to let it work on you, no matter what happens, it can change the mind. Sometimes, you have to wake up and see what is happening around you, because problems are the best way to change what you want to change over time. Problem is a change for yourself, because it can help you to see differently and understand how much you change than the others. For example, I remember that I was in the United States, that nothing will change me, because I believe that nothing will change because my country was different and that I am a realist because a problem can change you, but sometimes I can't change the way it is, but I think that changes are very shy, but I think that there are more problems that I will never see in my life, and that I can't see it.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,train

Students will present their list of things that our community needs! Because of these students, those who have low grades will get extra credit! Some students don't participate because their friends say it's a waste of time. It wouldn't be a waste of time to learn how our community can be a better place for us.

Also, courses in high school will help you choose your career, such as academy courses. As a student taking a career course, I will help them learn more about that career, and you will have background knowledge about that career. for example, I take car technology in high school because I want to learn more about cars and how to fix it. after high school, I will go to a community college so I can learn an advanced auto technology class and move on, and that means that I will be successful in life. Another reason why it is a good idea for students is to get involved in a career at a young age, because it will help students choose a good career that pays for a good idea and the students will waste a certain amount of time when they are completing a career, because it will make them more aware of their career choices.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,train

Probably it's because they are distracted in sports and don't have to do their job. Kids who have bad grades tend to be lazy, and if we let them be in the team, how can we expect kids to win if one of the members doesn't even attend school. Another reason why you should have good grades and shouldn't be able to get involved in school is that it's good to see when you're in college.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,train
"One of the smartest people in the world said, ""Fantasy is more important than knowledge."" Do you agree or disagree with Albert Einstein? What do you think about fantasy? Do you think fantasy is more important than knowledge? I agree with Albert Einstein, because if people focus on gaining more knowledge, people will not try to solve the problem with fantasy. If more people come to the U.S. than people or try to stop it and don't focus on the students and staff who need help when they are in need. If people pay their taxes, the money goes to solve the problem, then people should pay their taxes to solve the problem faster so that the children can have a learning environment. The more the president wants to work to pass a fantasy law, the more he should focus on the things he has run for president, not just one thing for years.

By allowing them to visit and explore, they will most likely know what they really want in life and in their upcoming future, and they can get a good job that pays money in the future. The first reason why it is a good idea to explore certain professions through internships is because students most likely know what they really want in life and it will help them start a good future.

One way the program can help both younger and older students is over. Both can learn about something they've never learned or want to learn young. Younger kids can teach the older ones how to say other things they learn. The older they can learn what they're learning in class.

Making new friends can be hard, but if you are only in a group, you can make friends with each other. One thing in a group that can be good and bad is to have disagreements with the group. There are many reasons why I prefer to work with a group and rather share this goal with you. In a group, it is about sharing new ideas and discoveries with the group that some people didn't know about. In a group, everyone would get good grades and take their exams. Some people in your group may have the same instinct as you and want to study this goal more and be motivated by someone else. In my opinion, working with a group is easier and more fun at the same time, and children will look at learning that way.A small problem when working with a group is that you have disagreements about the group that you are talking about.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,train

I wasn't a troublemaker in middle school, for example, and when I started my freshman year in high school, I wasn't a quiet kid for a while. It's because I was too nervous because it was my first year in a much bigger school. After a while, my classmates started to get to know me a bit more and realize how much of a troublemaker I was.

First, Thomas Jefferson spends his time with us because he wants to see how his people really follow his dreams. A lot of people don't think about what they can do in their lives when we still spend time with other people who we don't make our own dreams come true, sometimes people are shy and frightened with their dreams because other people can disturb them because they can make their dreams come true or they don't believe in them. Some people can't fulfill their dreams because they think we have a lot of stuff, but the reason is that they never try to make Jefferson's dreams come true, because they can write more about it and we can falsify them.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,train

"How should people make decisions?? that's the real question should a person follow a feeling or call movement instincts or should they make a decision through guidance from experts and the laws and authorities. Now, a person should really advise. For example, a businessman can say that he has to make a decision about whether to invest money or not in a product that has sold well in recent months, but in the passport that they have sold as much. So the businessman has to go and get guidance with some experts because he doesn't want to make the wrong decision and the company wants to waste money that they don't get back. That's why consultants are so helpful because they assume that people come out of any worries that a person has. They can guide and advise you to do things right. For example, if a person is in high school that that person has a guide, that person will always try to help, there is to decide which classes are best for a student, and it will take care of the student and look at why a student is not doing well and then try to help him make a problem.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,train

So, many students think that working as a group is better to help each other, but the teacher will think that many of us, who will improve each other and together, will do more things and will talk a lot also as a group and alone, because many students will do that to concentrate and pay attention to the class. The reason why people prefer to work with a group is that we want to work as a group, that we will work together and answer the question and convince the work.

If students work in groups, they can divide the task into different parts, so it can be easier for every person in the group to think that students in the group can help each other. Group work is also less stressful for every person in the group. First, if students work in groups, they could split the task into small parts. For example, if they have a global warming project, they could tell each person to find something different, one person can find the traits of global warming, another person can find the reasons why it is happening, and someone else can have some examples of the topic.

If you continue with good behavior, you have a higher chance that you will be respected in society even in your own home. good behavior is really a life inability that you need to get a job, how will you behave in front of the employer?

Mistakes help you to learn and get better and better until you understand the concept of what you are doing. Some people think that you will fail something through mistakes, but also realize that in the end you will get results from it. Many people fail every day and that does not mean that you are not perfect because no one in this world is perfect, but the basic idea is to look for the best way to manage or do something and also to look forward.

Self-esteem comes from achievement, once a goal is achieved, students will have self-confidence, which will result in students achieving more goals. Students who achieve their dreams will encourage others to try their best to be more successful. Students will become better leaders by encouraging others to fulfill their dreams as well. This gives students a mindset not to give up so easily. When students see others achieve their goals, it gives them hope to do the same, which leads students to try their best to accomplish their tasks in time and to give their full effort on topics that have empowered them.

Students want to take another class to finish school and get a job when you finish high school, that is why some students are not interested in taking music lessons.

So, when I went to the country, I experienced what she did and what she saw. When your friends or family members share their experiences with you, you start to imagine what they went through and what sometimes leads to preparation because they told you what they went through with them, they can prepare you. For example, your family has something where all the boys in the family try basketball, and you ask your older cousin how their experiences went and what they did well and badly. So you know what the coach wants to see and what he doesn't want to see, which means that you can show the coach and that can help you make the team proud and keep your family going, and if you can share your experience with your brother.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,train

Also, if you always do your work with empathy, the boos give you a good salary for your attitude and you can maintain your position. Second, if you have a positive attitude in your life, you have a better life like, emotionally, spiritually and peacefully for you.

For me, reading aloud helps a lot because I understand it better, because I read aloud, because I know how I'm reading. I can also see better whether I'm reading aloud or pausing with every word. Then, when I read aloud, I can see if I don't understand what it means. For me, reading aloud helps because I can explain what's going on in the story.

If the person trusts you, you don't have to lie to them so that it doesn't hurt there. Also, you can lose confidence in someone or lose the closeness to reality that you have with them.

First, they can ask questions at any time, second, improvements in learning new topics and finally, support in group work. First, many teenagers who take online courses still have questions or guesses about their answers. Here are some reasons why many students don't master some courses. Classes related to math, chemistry and history are the most complicated for most learners.

Do you think schools should extend the school hours by one hour and 30 minutes? I agree with this plan because it would help the education of the students. It can help the students in their education: Teachers would be able to explain more to the students so that they can understand properly. Teachers can help teach the students by using the extra time to do more projects. Teachers can read more books with the class so that they can be good readers and writers. It would give the students fewer school days: Students can spend more relaxed time and come to school with a lot of energy: Students can get more time to do homework and try to understand everything during the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes. Teachers can take the entire class to the library to check books with the classroom.

As if students had a five-day school week, there would be so much free time for the students to do what they want, like take care of responsibility, after school clubs, homework, learning. And free time is much more useful for the students. Now, some can argue that if the school had a four-day school week, they would have more time because they would have an extra day of school.

Besides, positive attitudes are good to live well and peacefully in every single place, there will be people who don't think like you, they just want to hurt you, but that people who are constantly angry are not their fault just because negative things happen around them.

In my school, I can see that there are already students who have done a wonderful job, but the president, teacher, would like to have something more to be proud of their school.

Nevertheless, I agree with Churchill's statement, because success follows failure. Failure really is an important part of any success. If I fail, I do not hesitate to hold back in pursuit of success. The greatest blessing in my life is to succeed after I have gone through failure.

Using the Google Translator is more important for some students that English is their second language as it is fast to browse the walls on it. Third, it is useful to manage different social media to be informed in some areas. Students can share information about the different programs, events or sports games they have at school.

First, kids need time to rest their brains there by going outside and watching a bit of TV. If schools add more time, then students don't have time to have fun, which means they don't have much time to sleep, their school day affects less time to sleep. An example of me having more time for my school, then I wouldn't have time to play, take a nap or watch YouTube. As a result, kids don't have enough sleep time to be healthy for the students.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students from home through online video conferencing. I think students will not benefit from attending classes from being at home. Some of the students have to work, do things at home or stay in school for other activities. Students sometimes actually need some help with some classes, but they don't want to go to classes at home, and the students who attend the class at home could be distracted by so many things.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,train

But, if I chose one, I would choose to work with a group because there are so many advantages, if you are stuck and need help, you can always ask for help from your group because there is more than one, working with your group is easier than working alone because you can do different parts at the same time, if you work alone, it takes longer, it becomes more difficult if you need help and don't know what to do. Collaboration gives us a bigger boost of an IQ, because several brains are better than one and give us a better overall score, or if the person who works alone and is very intelligent, he could find things easier.

Failure does not just mean giving up dreams and ideas, but giving them the choice to push them to their limits and overcome all challenges, failure can also help motivate any hope and be prepared for any challenge.

"In this world, everyone has a talent or ability. Some people use their talent for good things, and some for bad things. My talent is honesty, and I use that talent for good things like: I tell the truth all the time, never betray anyone, and I'm always fair. My first reason for using this talent for good things is that I tell the truth all the time. That's why everyone trusts me and tells me their secrets. Telling the truth all the time also helps people to recognize me as a good person and help me make many friends. Telling the truth all the time would not only help people to recognize me as a good person, but it would also lead everyone to trust me. To continue, my second reason for never cheating anyone is that people will think that I am a good person, and people who don't like me will lick on me.

I have the same impression that it was the most important day of my life and the impression that it can be easy or difficult, but I did it and I come to the united state.

To me, the first impression is not too important, because that first impression can change at any time, and the one how you can't give him a second change is better than the first one when I have a poster one day, and I was ugly when the teacher said that he has to do another poster in a group and no one wants to join my group, and I make the poster of myself when the teacher calibrates the poster, maybe the best one in the class.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,train

People in groups have less to do than one person, because everyone in a group is doing something and alone means that you have to do everything on your own.

They can focus on classes where they have more time to work in the school, or students who have children, pay babysitters the time when they are in school and want to continue learning. Students can have better grades, they can access it online anytime, they can focus on classes where they have more time to work in the assignment, they can add extra time to perform tests, homework, vocabulary, etc. They can more easily choose to memorize the information because they want the students.",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,train

Students should have time to go home and do their work, they should also have time to do their homework. If the students know that they have homework to do, they start to fail by not doing their work on time, if they do their work on time, their grades will drop.

The disadvantages of adding two extra hours to school can cause a lot of problems for the student and the teacher, especially for students who have jobs and have after-school activities such as sports and clubs. Also, the student will be tired after school and they will have less time with friends after school.

One year less makes all the difference. For example, the mother of a student is really ill and the student has a part-time job, but he does not gain enough money to buy his mother's medication and he needs to finish hard work with positive spirit, but he is still in his third year of high school, so now that he can make his degree in three years, he can get his diploma job, but he will not gain enough money to buy his mother's medication and he needs to finish his degree, but he is still able to finish his high school so he can be in his third year of high school.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,train

For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student would not have time to do things he has planned in the morning.But in the online school, that student can wake up late and take the time he has planned in the morning.My second reason is that it is less cheap.In the online school, students only need: a computer, a notebook and something to write with.Students also get free food from home. But in the regular school, some students pay money to get food, and supplies for each class can be costly.My last reason is that students should eventually make an online decision to finish their day of school and always play with friends.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,train

In the summer break, the students wait with Antusismus and work hard to finish work at school and enjoy the summer break, it helps them as a relaxation after school stress, they have to forget about school through a mother and relax their brains.

An optional subject can be helpful for students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different types of art classes and helps them understand what's going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where they came from and how it's being played. Art teaches students how to paint and sound and show them who the most famous painters are, where they came from and how they became such great artists.

Like, for example, if I choose geosystems over physics, I think twice about it because I know what the bad and the good things about this class could be, and then I go to what I think is better. Secondly, why I know that my own decisions are better because a person, when they make a decision, later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake.

Some students have no way to search for a topic or a problem because they do not have a computer with them, so the mobile phone is faster and easier to see through, exchange ideas with other students, position on a topic, political opinions, stay informed about what is going on outside school, students need to inform themselves about everything that is going on outside school, inflated student devices can cause a bad effect, and this will allow them to find another way to break the rules again and get what they want. I think students should be allowed to use mobile phones for this reason, to stay informed about what is going on outside school, students need to inform themselves about anything that is going on outside school, and this will allow them to pay for playing mobile phones outside school, because students may be distracted by having to use a lot of phones, however, because there is no social penalty caused by them going to use a lot of phones in school, and because there is no social penalty.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,train
"If you do not try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. ""In my opinion, I agree with this quote, because if you do not try to do better every day, you will not achieve your purpose. The more you have the experience of doing something, the better you must continue to do it, and you will improve every day. If you work on something you have already worked on, and you do not stop focusing on it, it will grow. The more things you learn, the better you will be in your life. My first reason, which supports my answer, is that you will not try to do better every day, you will not achieve your goal. If you try your best every day, you will not only grow your best in your life, but you will also make yourself proud. Some people have their goals, but they do not try their best.

We can't let students fail because it's important to have something to look forward to when they come to school. It's a clear requirement for students to go to classes like music, drama and art, but it would be fair to let them decide on their own behalf.

For example, it is better to play in a team sport with teammates than to try to do it all alone, the same with a big project. Just like the saying that two heads are better than one. defiantly, if you help working on a project, it will also save a lot of time, because no one will correct you on paper. Another advantage of working in a group is more ideas that come from other people and that you can learn from it. Not only that if a person is attached to something that the group is working together with help in solving a problem, it will also save a lot of time if you try to work on your own.Working in a team, which the PE teacher assigns you, is hard to work in a team, trying to work alone in a group or in a group.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,2.5,3.5,train

I think with success you can learn a lot of experience in your life, because with your failure you learn about that you can learn it because you do not try it and you do not exploit because you exploit yourself, so if you can see a problem, how far you can go to solve the problem, or maybe you do not try the mistake.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,train

"Striving too low and falling short is not the best way to be successful. Confidence in what you do is great, but what if you are too confident? Not everyone has the same definition of success; your vision of success might be the way you see failure. By setting your goals low, you are taking the potential risk of not achieving the necessary capacities you expect. If the goals are set high, you are also sure to achieve your grades, have the pride of being successful, and are confident in what you do, it also affects your mood, so you are satisfied with how well you are doing, have the desire to do even better. The science fair is coming up this month; making a project about volcanoes sounds like a good idea, you know the topic and have done it once before, teachers love projects that demonstrate real life actions, although they all do; this idea is unoriginal, and five other students think just like you, by doing the volcano project, you may come out with no real purpose, you may need to achieve your goals low.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,train

I believe that every person has two faces. 1 is used at work or at school, and the other face shows certain moments in his life as a stress or his football team loses 5-2. An example of this is: When you are so angry and involuntary, you use a bad word, and after that you feel very comfortable with yourself. Although what you do is part of you for what you have done is broken; this simple thinking makes you more human than anyone else in this world, because you inevitably have to try to be perfect when you are not ready to be perfect in this achievement and wonderful world. If you look more closely at my statement, you can talk about it; a ten-year-old, who is 17 years old, celebrated his birthday in January when he came to the United States, he had 14 years in 3 years at school at that time.

If students don't take these classes, they can also graduate more easily, then let them do it. For example, I go to a high school where I get the credits I need, and I'm able to finish a year early.

"I agree with the idea of a year-round school because it sounds great to me. This idea has many advantages for the students and also for the teachers. This idea provides a beneficial environment for both the students and the teachers. One of the reasons why this is a great idea is that students can easily keep information when they come back from recess. They would easily keep information because the break that was given to them was not a long break, and that will help them remember the materials they were taught before recess. The other reason is that students will gain more knowledge by learning more materials. They will learn a lot from which they will benefit, not only inside the school, but also outside the school. They will also stick to the task and focus more on their studies. Another reason is that this idea of a year-round school will make the work easier for the teachers. It will facilitate their work by not repeating the materials that the teachers previously taught, because the students will be able to create the new materials and they will not be forced to memorize good ones, and they will be able to do a good job.",2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,train

You feel very comfortable around people when you learn together. Bonding with someone is really important to communicate with your friends, if you forget what happens the next day, you could ask your friends.

The school council should not add more hours, because if the students have appointments, they have to schedule a later time, but if the place of their appointment closes a little earlier, the students will have to leave school, and that will cause them missing work, late work, more work at home with little time and more stress for the students to finish work on time. If the school council adds hours, it will be a disaster for the students who have a job and have to get there on time, even if they live far away from their job, their boss might get angry with them because they are too late, and if they don't believe their worker, they might be fired and then the students will have no job and they won't have money to pay for what they need to add to the school.This is the reason the school council should not add.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,train

Self-confidence is very important for the person to become independent. If you don't trust yourself, how will they grow. As Micheal Jordan famously said, ""you miss 100% of the shots you don't make.""

Nowadays, a four-day working week is very rare because this system is new; people are always wary when something new comes out, but then they understand better. The four-day timetable is more balanced, more energy-efficient and more variable. Therefore, I believe that our school should follow the new timetable. First, the forty-day school week is better distributed because students would have more time for rest and homework, thus increasing their ability to learn. On the other hand, ten hours in school could be exhausting for the students, but the school administration could make the breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of fatigued students. Second, the four-day timetable reduces energy and resource consumption.

Being yourself is one of the best things in this world because you don't have to act differently in front of other people just to be accepted. One of the advantages of being yourself is when you are loved by someone as you are, you are not afraid to hurt that person because of your bad actions.

It will most likely be better if you ask more than one person for good advice, because a person who might not please other people can just go to one person, or you can try something different and ask someone else, but if you just want to ask one person you have to trust so that they can give you something good back and give you good information. If I wanted to ask someone for advice, I would go to a person who is very wise and make wise decisions so that they can help me make wise choices so that I cannot make the bad decisions, make sure you go to the right person.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,train

So, if someone reads the invitation, they can execute their success and should not fail in the future business, then the further business can think about it. Then, if they have no enthusiasm, they will not succeed in the not too distant future. After all, what I think about Churchill's prompt statement is that failure in success plays a very important role.

Self-responsible people know how to get their important or ""life-changing"" decisions through. For example: Buying your own house, getting married and dropping out of school are all very important decisions that you and only yourself can make. They think about what decision they will make.

Someone says that the school should not follow this model by extending the school day by two hours, because only four-day students cannot learn enough knowledge.

But sometimes teenagers do not deserve what they have, for example the school, the job, the people they love.

"""The school adds an hour and thirty minutes on a school day."" Frankly, I neither agree nor disagree with some of their pros and cons on this subject.

Another professional is if you have questions about your homework, the teacher can help you by teaching you, and you don't have to worry about time because you have many minutes to learn. Second, if their classes are longer, the kids will sit back more and pay more attention when their favorite class will be good for them because theirs will be longer. For me, I love music lessons, if I have more time in that class, I could learn more things about music and I could be a better player. Third, it gives us more time to hang out with our friends because they might be busy, because they do sports or church.

If the younger kids don't have that much time to sit down and help them at work, then they can just get help from the learning program that is happening at school.

They have patience and do not become irritated as easily as others. Giving up is never an option, especially when it comes to something they love or have a dream. People who have this trait usually do not stress so much because they turn the negative into the positive.",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,train

Today, people can't live without technology because it has made their lives easier, and it's hopeful for all those who work, who go to high school and also when they stay at home. Technology allows people to do a lot of tasks without having contact with others. Today, people don't go to the companies and ask for an application. They use technology to make a resume and wait for what the company will say. It's easy for people who don't have transportation, they can get a job by staying at home and using technology.

However, not all would agree with this position because it brings advantages to working alone, because most students don't have to wait for others to do their work. For example, the teacher assigns a project and they have to do their work in groups of five and two of the students, and the other three don't do their work. It brings everyone else down. Working alone doesn't make students worried that others won't do their part of the work. Most students get different ideas when working in groups.

Reason number two is that once they graduate from high school, they may want to apply for community service for the college approval there.

You can always tell the truth because honesty is always helpful and good because you have done a good thing.

I also think that people ask more than another person because sometimes people don't have ideas with which they need help. Some people need a better choice, so it's better to ask other people than just think of their own ideas, because listening to other people's thoughts can make your ideas better.

By allowing your children to help make decisions about entertainment or snacks, you are giving them a place in the family where they will realize that their voice is being heard.

It teaches them to work hard together and to have responsibility. my favorite pastime in a science experiment is teamwork. I think that working together is important because it teaches children to connect as a family, to talk to each other about it and to learn what mistakes you made in doing so. Even if you don't make a mistake, you still end up learning different things, like tying and learning how to do the experiment. The activity is fun because my friends and I do experiments together as a group. We assign a different task to a person so that everyone can work.

I do not believe that a negative attitude is always difficult to be satisfied with life, because sometimes good miracles happen. If there were more successful people in the world, all would be positive satisfaction. Most people are mixtures of both satisfactions.Attitudes influence people's lives so much what satisfaction they have. In conclusion, a positive attitude brings a lot of success in life, I think that more people should have a positive satisfaction.A person who has a positive attitude cannot always enjoy life so well that they are satisfied with their attitude. an attitude is the key to a fulfilled life.",3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,train

You might think that for some reason people get a bad grade point, but that's not the case.

"Dear teacher, I was asked if it is more useful to work in a group with students or to work alone. I think it is more advantageous to work in a group than to do all the work alone. I think group work is less stressful for the student, but helps to do the work faster and easier. I have noticed that people do better in group projects because the work can be split between the students and not just between a person doing all the work that is difficult to understand or all the work is done on time. Working as a group mainly helps those students who are really not doing their work on time or have problems understanding what to do, and they can ask the students in the group for more support or a clearer explanation. For example, if a student who works alone does not understand the concept of the project and does not need to ask anyone or simply does not want to ask, they ask the teacher if they are either doing it wrong or simply not doing it because they cannot do this additional job because they are the person at the top of the group of you, if you are in trouble or if someone else is trying to help you or if you are having more trouble.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,train

For example, my boyfriend is a year older than me and helps me with school work when I need it. Older students can help teachers by helping students with class work. Having older students in a program can be useful because they can show younger students how to behave properly in class and show others what they need to do.

The school itself puts a lot of pressure on the students and with one hour of extra school time it becomes much more difficult. The school council should not add hours to the school because the students are already accustomed to the hours they come out of school. At one and a half hours the students would probably get too much pressure on handling some school materials. Students would also get a lot more school work.

By doing that, they can also share with their family. Making other people happy makes you even happier by showing other people. It doesn't have to be random people, it can be your friend.

First, at all, students can use mobile phones for emergencies or use Google translation because it sometimes takes minutes to find out in the dictionary.

Second, sometimes teachers put out worksheets or colors in the Google classroom and we have to do this by using a computer and sometimes computer gate very slowly and we can do this by using mobile phones. Third: We know that some students use mobile phones for bad suggestions, such as not paying attention in class or bulling other classmates.

Even if the student observes his game and he plays really well, it's difficult to change the first impressions because he still doesn't look like an athletic person and the student knows how unhealthy he is.

I believe that lost battles and wars help us to create the United States of America new weapons that wither, whether it was nuclear or bullets. Another reason why I would say that is because without those battles and wars like wouldve we found out about atomic bombs or hardened steel bullets. It sounds crazy and highly ephemeral to be fallen heroes who were killed in action, but if we win wars and battles we would soon fall. Because we use the same positions and plans to win, and we would also feel too sure that Henrey is one to be confident of the automobile team to rediscover the world's number two weapons, and we will use those very same ones again.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,train

There are several reasons that should be taken into account when debating this issue, for example: Art classes will require a block that can be used for a class that the student is interested in, or it could be used for a class that the student needs to obtain a degree. As a student interested in an advanced diploma, I believe that art classes will not help anyone achieve their goal of obtaining the advanced diploma, even if students are able to choose their own classes that they will gain experience in this area and be more successful if students are able to make their choice, if they are really interested in the class, if someone else in the class decides on the arts, and they don't like it.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,train

However, if you have kind, loving parents, you have a higher chance of becoming a nice, loving person. Remember, we are with our family every day, so we would most likely end up like that. We can't choose our community either, so it's out of our control. Personally, I feel that the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our lives because it determines what kind of people you grow up with, around whom you grow up.

Then, I would never be able to ask another person for help and ideas, and I would most likely turn to myself.

For example, if the school choice classes that you dislike and do not like have to stick to them. Also, you would be very stressed that you are in this class and that stress can negatively affect other classes. My second reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is that idf students decide to do more activities that they gain more experience in different categories.

"Dear Principal, I think you should allow the students of your school to use their cell phones when they have time to do so. Students should remember that if the teacher asks them to always express it well, but they should also remember that they have the right to use it. Will that be the reason why I think it is okay to allow the students to have phones there, on the one hand, because they want to spend time at school calling friends who may not be in the same school, or if they have something important to do in them after school. Secondly, if they need help and one is with them. Well, what you might say is that the students will never leave their phones, even if they are there in classes. Will there be any punishment for that person who does not follow the rules?

Some of the students don't know what the teacher is teaching about because learning there is perhaps the weakest strength to pass.

There are more reasons, but those are my motivations. If you go to school, you learn. The longer you stay, the more you learn. The more you learn, the easier it is to get into collage.

To clarify this, let's dig deep. First, I think it's important that you understand who they are because you know about their favorite hobbies, the places they want to visit, the pets they have, and their dream vacation.

My first reason for this is that some people think that they are not preparing to be too high and fail. For example, if a person sets their goal too high but fails, that person does not feel comfortable about him. Sometimes, people get depressed. If that is a person who is a stubborn person, he tries to spend more time.

However, many students are unable to perform at their best because they have low self-confidence, which is mainly caused by the lack of praise and incentives from their parents, teachers or coaches. This shows how important it is for teachers and parents to praise their students and motivate them to work harder. Praising a student's work is critical to their productivity because it builds their self-confidence.

A very famous saying is, for example, ""After the storm comes the calm."" This can be similar to Churchill's saying, because it explains that it does not matter how you see it, but it would be great after the problems or you fight with them. Moreover, in order to succeed, you would pass over hard things, for example, something that people say, ""Nothing is impossible if you don't try it."" and ""Nothing is easy in this life."" This is a true statement that all people have to do and we have to know. In addition, the word ""failure"" plays an important role in order to succeed.

And now he says that it is not a good idea to leave school for money.

Giving students the opportunity to participate in classes online is a great responsibility; which means that they have to follow instructions and do classwork. It is true that most students have no problem with this, they do their agenda and tasks, so they are more comfortable with this learning method, but this learning method is not always the case for some students because they have the opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes, so they start to fool around and sometimes become distracted. Attitudes like this can result in: not meeting deadlines, lack of daily classwork, lack of understanding and ultimately failure. Students with poor learning skills would be incompetent to take online classes, which means that their students must be instructors for this kind of students at all costs.

"I don't think school districts should allow students to finish early. I think that's a bad idea because students have to take more classes than they would normally take, students have to stay after school or maybe even go to summer school, so they can get enough credits to finish early, and students would be very stressed if they had to learn all this material for each of their classes, because they don't have compulsory voting. Therefore, I don't think that school districts should allow students to finish early, and that they have to take additional classes during the school year to earn credits for their classes. In many schools, you have to have at least four credits in one subject, so that means that students most likely have to take two classes of one subject in order to earn credits for that one particular subject. Some students who finish early may have a difficult time catching up on all of their classes, which can result in them having to stay after school to take tutoring classes if they don't understand material.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,train

Some students will work after school, they will need time to go home and prepare for work, and with school days that are longer, it would be pointless to work, they will do 3 or 4 hours a day, some students, especially in senior year, will have to pay bills or earn money for the future to pay the college.

I think just because a student does not have a b grade or higher does not mean that they cannot play in a place or in an activity. Maybe they are not so intelligent, but they try best, but they may not be able to succeed. Sometimes, children cannot improve because they have problems at home, the teachers may not notice it.

Yes, because the more time you have in school, the more time you will learn and get help. If you go to school two hours more on a four-day school week, the more school work can be done and learned. I think my school should neglect this model because in my opinion test and quiz results will show a greater improvement over time.The first reason why my school should have a four-day school with two hours is because a lot of school work can be done at school and teachers would have more time to explain details with deeper nobility.

In contrast, we lose hours on other things that are not necessary; with more hours and days off, students would be distracted from the responsibilities that school demands.

The student would like to have a four-day school week, but he doesn't want an extra two hours in school, which is a disadvantage if he is considering going to a four-day school and only getting a few hours himself and going to school really early. The good advantage of this is that the student has a three-day weekend for the whole school year and has more time to do his homework or the work he misses to catch up on the grade for that class. The other disadvantage is if these other two are added is that the student doesn't pay attention and loses the focus on class, also working there or falling asleep in class. If I go to a school that had two hours more, I probably don't pay attention to my teacher or lose my focus and go to sleep until school closes.

If students decide to become a nurse or doctor, they go to a central medical service or hospital and get information about that career, or they go to a mechanics workshop to learn and gain knowledge about how to become a mechanic. It is a good idea for students to think about a career at a young age or try to prepare for the future and take some courses in high school, because if the teens are trying to find a career that can be enjoyable for them and try to learn about it, it is a good idea for them to do the high school.",3.0,3.0,3.5,2.0,2.0,3.0,train

For example, if you build a house but have little knowledge of the construction, the one who builds the house will sometimes fail and fail, but the best way to accomplish something is to learn from the mistakes on the journey, the best way to do it. Not only learning from mistakes helps to succeed, but it also helps to improve each other.Improvement is a great key to success, but failure always has a role in success, but it happens to help to improve or become better.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,train

Another reason why curfews might make teenagers safer is that teenagers think they know everything in this world, but in reality they don't know what the world really is like and anything can happen at any time. The last reason why I think some teenagers need to have curfews is that some teenagers are not mature enough to be out late at night and something might happen to them.

First, by taking online courses at the end of the semester, students learn nothing. Second, students are very easily distracted most of the time, they do not focus on what they are focusing on. Ultimately, it is more convenient for someone to teach them something literally face to face. First, sometimes students do not learn anything in the classroom, imagine themselves in front of a computer. In other words, at home students will do everything in a hurry just to finish it quickly and do something else.

But Kahoot keeps kids more active when they learn, and gives the teacher better control over the kids. Besides, Kahoot is easy to teach because when kids use paper and books, the teacher has to go to the kids one by one to correct their mistakes, but when teachers use Kahoot, they can explain the right answer faster and better to the whole class.Teachers who use papers and books are always tried because they have to grade them, one by one, and can't go home until their kids are done and teachers sometimes get really lazy.

If you find yourself extreme, for example, finding yourself extreme means positive things along the way, if you find yourself extreme, positive things along the way, for example, you have confidence in yourself, you know yourself better now, you are ready to face what comes because you are pleasing.If you appreciate this moment for me, I appreciate it for you.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,train

Problems make your brain grow up, imagine you are on a math test and don't know the answer, probably you will be afraid, but if you have a hard time remembering what the answer is, you will find it, problems are usually too difficult to solve, and this fact helps you to get your brain to find a way to solve the problems, and get your brain to grow up by using all your energy to think about what you can do in that situation. Giving problems gives you knowledge, there should be a reason that you are in a problem, if you are in school or somewhere with another person, office, or if you have a problem, or if you have a problem that someone will call you to the police, or if you probably have a problem, if you have a problem, or if you have a problem with the police, if you have a problem, if you have a problem, if you have a problem, if you have a problem, if you have a problem, if you have a problem, if you have a problem, if you have a problem, if you have a problem, if you have",3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,train

"Some schools offer distance classes as an option for students to take classes from home through line or videoconferencing 。 I think there is no benefit for students who take classes online because in the video maybeabilities, and dont have a teacher is not organized dont help with kahoot or quizlet or with other strategies of work.Organized: When you take the video online you do not have a teacher who tells you what you need to do in class, and he cannot help you with your work, for example, the teacher may not have a partner or other people with you, only with your teacher online, but not your confidence or your friend like in school the many people have not organized, if you need highlights or pensil to write something to read it or explain your work 。 Partners: in the class you do not have partners or other people with you, are only with your teacher online, but is not your confidence or your friend like in school the many people is your French, but people can say that you cannot take the class because you can work for the students for ten hours 。",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,train
"I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success, because in life, no matter what you do, you need a positive attitude. For example, when you go to a job interview, you get to the place where you don't get the job with a positive attitude. It's like getting a job, you have to have a positive attitude when you work with others or with customers. I think that in life everyone needs a positive attitude to achieve their goals. I think that people who don't have a positive attitude don't get very far in life, because when I was in middle school, I never had a positive attitude and I would get into a lot of trouble because of my attitude, and now that my attitude towards success in life has changed, I think that in everything you do in life you need a positive attitude.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,train
"The time students have to do their homework to decide whether they want to be active after school or not, students should decide for themselves whether they want to earn money to pay the bills, or whether they have the time they need to work. Students, too, must be free to decide after school whether they want to work after school, or whether they want to earn money to pay the bills. If students have the time they need to help their parents, they must decide for themselves whether they want to work or not.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,train

"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's ""To be in a world where you're constantly trying to do something different is the greatest achievement,"" because in this generation kids are trying to fit in with other kids by changing the way they talk or dress. Children are also trying to fit in by doing what others tell them and making stupid decisions that could potentially end up in jail or maybe even worse for their future just because they wanted to fit in. peer pressure is a major factor in kids trying to fit in. Children are pushing other kids to make bad decisions when they don't really want to, but they want to look cool in front of other kids so they do it anyway. In reality, it's not cool to do what people tell you to do, especially when it's just about fitting in with others. In my opinion, people shouldn't make bad decisions when they're trying to fit in with others, but they shouldn't put on with the others, no matter what clothes they're wearing or who they're accepted by.",2.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,train
"I believe that some students learn more easily about technology than about paper markers, but I also believe that mobile phones can be used for bad purposes such as games and apps, texting, etc. I believe that mobile phones can drop grads. I have been through everything and seen everything, I am a student myself, and sometimes when our teachers allow us to use our mobile phones, I take the chance to review my texts and I would see my classmates do the same, but then we have moments when we really need to gather information or our teacher would like to play an online game, then it is really useful.

"Most students, however, prefer to work in a group because working with others is more advantageous for the students.

"""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" What I think about this quote is that you can't do your best in every problem. If you're still holding on to what it means at all, as I was in the first few minutes of your life, it means that in every challenge you see, there's always a way to try your best and overcome that challenge, regardless of what your mind tells you, because that's your biggest enemy you'll ever face. I don't particularly agree with this quote, because in certain problems, even if you try your best, you'll still fail or if you don't want to solve the problem or other people around you, then you'll most likely fail. In trying to get to get to that quote, there's a chance for you to do your best, ""it should be:"" For every problem or challenge, there's always a way to solve the problem or other people around you, ""and then there will be a four-week deadline, and here are a couple of examples: If you do it in your 4th year.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,train
"Many people disagree with Albert Schweitzer's quote: ""Example is not the main thing when it comes to influencing others; it's the only thing."" They think that it doesn't matter who did it, that the thing that matters is the example. In my case, Albert Schweitzer was right with his quote. Although many people say that there are better ways to influence others than just with their own experience, because there are famous people with more interesting examples, the best way to influence others is because it shows that you were able to do it, no matter how hard it was for you, and yet you will inspire other people to do their own example based on your ideals.

"I think that failure is the main thing for people who want to achieve their goal, because they have to have the idea that success comes after failure, secondly, they have to be positive and think what they want and how they want to achieve their success in life, and thirdly, they have to be prepared to deal with failure, because they know that not everything will be as they want it to be, but that they have in mind that everything is possible, that everything is possible, and that they have the idea that failure must come, because they have to keep the failure in mind, that not everything will be as they want it to be, but as it will be, that everything is possible, that everything is possible, and that people can do what they want it to do, that it can be done, that they can do it, that they can do it, that they do it, that they do it, that they don't do it, that they don't do it, that they don't do it, that they don't do it, that they don't do it, that they don't do it, that they don't do it.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,train
